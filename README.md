# CS255_System_Analysis-Design
Culmination of work for CS-255 System Analysis and Design at SNHU. 


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

//DriverPass was a private company looking to establish and expland the availability of new driver education. They wanted to design a system that would allow for the online delivery of education content directly related to new/student drivers, while also allowing for the scheduling of in person on the road driving sessions with driving instructors. The main goal of the client was to increase the success rate of students in passing the driving exams. 

What did you do particularly well?

//I beleive I thoroughly identified the functional and non-functional requirements and designed a comprehensive system that kept the client's and end user's needs in mind. The numerous UML diagrams were also clear and concise giving a clear visual representation of the system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

//I would choose to complete a more thorough and detailed UML Class diagram of the system. THough the UML class diagram that I submitted was complete, there were not aspects that were not required to be implemented at this time leaving a few items that could be expanded upon by a more completed diagram. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

//Initially I created a System Components and Design document which allowed me to easily identifiy the key needs of the end user and the needs, objectives and goals of the client, DriverPass. By having a more thorough understandning of these rquirements, I was able to design a system that meet the expectations and requests of the client. Understanding the needs of the user is vital in designing a system that is user friend and useful to the user. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

//When designing software, I begin by gathering and analyzing the requirements, both functional and non-functional. I then create various UML diagrams, such as use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, to visually represent the system's design and understand the relationships and interactions between different components. I also consider security aspects, limitations, and any potential scalability issues. In the future, I would continue using these techniques and strategies, while also staying up to date with new design methodologies and best practices to ensure that I deliver effective and efficient system designs that cater to the user's needs.
